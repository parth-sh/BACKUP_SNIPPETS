Test Cases

5342, 3478


Not able to do questions on thursday and friday


Array, Hashing, 2 pointer, sliding window. (Feeling better)
Trees, LinkedList -> In progress
Backtracking, Heaps -> To be finished today.
Graph -> Tomorrow
DP -> Day after tomorrow

Speed. Using timer.
Distractions are over.
Correctness -> Drastic improvements
// After thinking a little, able to come up with solution.
// Make comments and intuitions
// Convert that into code

Focus on Neetcode 150 (Target by 12th June).

Union-Find Set Data Structure/ Disjoint Set (very important) ->
Interval Trees (less important)
Randomness -> Playlist shuffle (Leetcode) -> understand that properly on what's happening.


Sudoku Solver (Valid Sudoku) -> Backtracking
Conditions -> 

-> square root of a number.
================================================

Problem: Are you thinking of assumptions (where is unclarity?)
Example input -> 

Solution -> multiple approaches (time and space complexity).
Coding -> Variables, function naming.
