Not able to do questions on thursday and friday


Array, Hashing, 2 pointer, sliding window. (Feeling better)
Trees, LinkedList -> In progress
Backtracking, Heaps -> To be finished today.
Graph -> Tomorrow
DP -> Day after tomorrow

Speed. Using timer.
Distractions are over.
Correctness -> Drastic improvements
// After thinking a little, able to come up with solution.
// Make comments and intuitions
// Convert that into code

Focus on Neetcode 150 (Target by 12th June).

Union-Find Set Data Structure/ Disjoint Set (very important) ->
Interval Trees (less important)
Randomness -> Playlist shuffle (Leetcode) -> understand that properly on what's happening.


Sudoku Solver (Valid Sudoku) -> Backtracking
Conditions -> 

-> square root of a number.
================================================

Problem: Are you thinking of assumptions (where is unclarity?)
Example input -> 

Solution -> multiple approaches (time and space complexity).
Coding -> Variables, function naming.

// input Structure
output function_name(inputs);

Dry Run -> (input)

// test inputs -> 


-> you are given a sorted list of integers. You have to find a target integer.
========================================================================
- 0 +
- 3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5
target = -1

// code, dry run
// Test Cases you can think of. What are the scenarios that could happen.

// binary search direction (left, direction)
- 3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5
target = -1

- 3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5
target = 6

[] [1]
target = 1
