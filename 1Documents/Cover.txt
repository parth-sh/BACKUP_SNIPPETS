I have more than 5 years of experience with full-stack development, especially using NodeJS and React, where I have built products that many people use. In my current job, I have worked with AI technologies to make things easier and better for users.

I like Postmanâ€™s goal of making API development simpler and I am eager to be a part of your team to keep building great tools for developers. I learn quickly and like taking on new challenges, which I believe makes me a good fit for this role.
