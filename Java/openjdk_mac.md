# ðŸš€ **OpenJDK@17**

To install OpenJDK 17 using Homebrew, you can use the following command:

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade && brew cleanup
brew install openjdk@17
```

```shell
For the system Java wrappers to find this JDK, symlink it with
  sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-17.jdk

openjdk@17 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have openjdk@17 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openjdk@17 you may need to set:
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/include"
```
