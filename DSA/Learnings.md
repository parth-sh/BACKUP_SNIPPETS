Problem Solving Strategy

- Read problem and constraints.
Read the problem statement.
Identify constraints and requirements.
Clarify assumptions and ambiguities.

- Simplify for intuition.
Break down the problem into simpler parts.
Write pseudocode for better structure.

- Write code.
Implement the solution.
Focus on variable names and modularity.

- Test all cases.
Dry run with sample inputs (e.g., 5342, 3478).
Check for edge cases and refine if necessary.

- Refine if needed.
Analyze time and space complexity.
Refactor for optimization if needed.

- Submit.
Validate correctness.
Submit and review.
